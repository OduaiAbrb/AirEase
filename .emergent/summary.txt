The AI engineer began by dissecting the comprehensive Airease MVP requirements, which included flight price monitoring, notifications, auto-purchase, AI-driven recommendations, time budgeting, OCR, and missed-flight recovery. Following user-provided API keys (flight, OpenAI, simple email) and a suggestion for phased development, a five-phase plan was established.

Early development focused on core flight search (Phase 1), which quickly demonstrated local functionality but exposed a persistent external 502 routing issue. Phases 2 and 3 introduced email notifications and AI recommendations, successfully implemented and tested locally despite the external URL problem.

A major turning point involved addressing user feedback on UI aesthetics and the critical 502 error. This led to a UI redesign (Google Flights-inspired), a shift to entirely mock data, and an attempt to integrate Emergent LLM technology. During debugging, a crucial route conflict ( vs. ) and an issue with  library were identified and fixed by creating specific API routes and removing the problematic package. This finally resolved the external URL  and  errors.

Subsequently, preference-based price matching with a demo was implemented, followed by the initial setup of advanced features (mock OCR, time budgeting, Stripe integration) as part of Phase 5. The current work involves enhancing UI with images/animations, improving user flows for advanced features, making mock data more realistic, and implementing the missed flight recovery feature, directly addressing the latest user requests.

<product_requirements>
The Airease application aims to be an MVP web app for continuous flight ticket price monitoring, price-matching, and user notifications. Key features include email alerts (with optional auto-purchase), packing/clothing recommendations based on destination weather, conservative time budgeting from home to plane, boarding pass OCR extraction, and missed-flight recovery suggestions.

The platform is built with Next.js (React/Tailwind) on serverless API routes using Supabase (free tier for Auth/DB), SendGrid/Mailgun (sandbox for email), Stripe (test mode for payments), and Tequila/Skyscanner/Amadeus (sandbox for flight data via adapters). OpenRouteService/OSRM for routing, Open-Meteo for weather, and Tesseract/ocr.space for OCR. OpenAI (Azure OpenAI/Emergent LLM) is used for packing/clothing/travel tips.

**User Data & Preferences:** Supports origin/destination (IATA or city), date window, time preferences, preferred/blocked airlines, baggage count, max price, notification email, and auto-buy opt-in (Stripe token only).

**Core Functionality:**
*   **Price Monitoring:** Scheduled checks, email notifications (offer, ETA, packing, buy link, auto-buy option), and sandbox booking.
*   **Time Budgeting:** Computes transit and airport times, displays leave-by timeline.
*   **OCR Boarding Pass:** Extracts flight details (number, date, time, gate, passenger) from images.
*   **Missed Flight Recovery:** Searches/presents alternative flights, attempts sandbox auto-purchase.
*   **UI Enhancements:** Desired Google Flights-style UI, inclusion of plane images and animations, and better user flows for scanning and auto-pay.
*   **Realistic Data:** Mock data to be realistic, enabling actual price matches and locations and departures and times and landing based on user input.
*   **Preference-based Matching:** A dedicated page for users to input detailed preferences (e.g., landing at 5 PM, direct flights), which triggers an 8-second demo loading and confirms found exact needs.

**Acceptance Criteria:** Price match triggers email, auto-buy succeeds (sandbox), OCR achieves â‰¥70% accuracy, time budgeting shows breakdown.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Next.js (React, Tailwind CSS):** Frontend and serverless API routes.
- **MongoDB:** Database for user data and watchlists.
- **Emergent LLM / Azure OpenAI:** AI for packing recommendations, travel tips.
- **Email.js:** Simple email sending for notifications.
- **Mock Data:** Used extensively for flights, OCR, payments, and weather.
- **Adapter Pattern:** Suggested for swappable integrations (flight providers, OCR).
- **Phased Development:** Structured approach (Phase 1-5).
- **Error Handling & Fallback:** Frontend gracefully handles API errors (502) with demo data.
- **Specific API Routes:** Transitioned from catch-all  to individual API route files.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a Next.js full-stack architecture, utilizing file-based routing for both frontend pages and backend API endpoints.


-   ****: The main frontend component, serving as the dashboard. It has undergone multiple rewrites to implement core search, watchlist UI, AI recommendations display, preference matching flow, navigation to advanced features, and a fallback mechanism for external API errors. It now includes enhanced error handling and UI elements like a search form, flight results display, AI recommendations panel, and header buttons for testing notifications.
-   ****: The root layout for the Next.js application, defining the overall structure and including global styles.
-   ** (various  files)**: These implement the backend API endpoints. Initially, a catch-all  was used, but due to routing conflicts and external 502 errors, it was replaced with specific route files like , , , , , , , and . These handle flight search, watchlist creation/retrieval, health checks, email testing, price monitoring, AI recommendations, OCR, and auto-buy logic.
-   ****: Manages email sending logic, used by the price monitoring and notification system. It has been enhanced to include AI-generated content.
-   ****: Handles integration with the Emergent LLM (using the provided Azure OpenAI key) for generating AI recommendations.
-   ****: Orchestrates the AI recommendation logic, fetching weather and then generating packing and travel tips using the LLM.
-   ****: Contains the logic for scheduled price checks against user-defined targets and triggers email notifications.
-   ****: Provides more sophisticated mock flight data, intended to simulate more realistic prices, locations, and timings. This was recently added to address user feedback.
-   ****: Introduced for time budgeting calculations as part of Phase 5.
-   ** & **: New pages added for advanced features, handling Stripe test payments and mock OCR respectively.

<pending_tasks>
- Complete the implementation and integration of the missed flight recovery feature.
- Refine the user flow for OCR boarding pass scanning and auto-purchase, ensuring they are properly linked with flight selection for a good user experience.
- Enhance mock data realism to allow for more precise actual price matches and locations and departures and times and landing based on user input.
- Further UI/UX improvements, including animations, as per user requests.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on fulfilling the user's latest set of enhancement requests. This included a complete redesign of the Airease application to incorporate professional visuals, animations, and a more robust user experience resembling Google Flights.

Specifically, the engineer:
1.  **Fetched high-quality images:** Utilized the  twice to obtain multiple relevant aviation and travel-related images for the application's UI, addressing the user's request for an img of a plane and a good repesntqble web page with imgs and animations.
2.  **Started integrating realistic mock data:** Created and updated  and modified  to begin using more sophisticated mock data. This directly addresses the user's need for increase the size of the mock up data and make them realistic when i type the actual price i want actual price matches and locations and departures and times and landing.
3.  **Initiated Missed Flight Recovery implementation:** The last explicit action was Now let me add the missed flight recovery feature and update the API endpoints:, indicating this feature is actively being worked on. This responds to the user's request to add the feature of the if flight not reached.

The current state involves these significant updates to the core  for UI and data handling, alongside the introduction of a new library for flight data and the ongoing backend work for missed flight recovery. The previous major issue of external URL 502 errors and page not found has been successfully resolved, allowing the application to function correctly on Emergent servers.
